Notes for moving Lab 04 from Java to Python 2.6

Stacker:

print_symbols probably isn't a good method example becuase python allows string multiplication (see stacker.py).


Primes:

it's not too hard to have students also print out the twin primes themselves.  See primes.py.


Mastermind:

Since strings are immutable in Python (s[2] = x doesn't work), I suggest using a list of values rather than a string of characters for the codes.  This can also provide practice for list mapping.  Alternatively, just the clue method could convert the string to a list.
