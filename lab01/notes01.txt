Notes for moving Lab 01 from Java to Python 2.6

I. H. McCreery

It's probably pragmatic to introduce the Python prompt during this lab, too, for testing.  If not, then certainly during lecture.

Hello:

Naming conventions should be reviewed:
	http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
In particular, module names should be "short, all-lowercase name", and "hello.py" is the one used by Summerield in his "Programming in Python 3".

We should consider adding information on shebang lines, though this gets confusing because of the version issues.

We should take out the part about compiling, or edit it severely.

hello_alt.py is an alternative 1st program that impliments the main method convention, but this can probably be saved for later.

Errors:

Many of the errors don't make sense anymore, especially ones having to do with syntax, and especially if a main method isn't going to be implimented yet.

Greetings:

This is a lot less complicated in Python.  No Scanner variables, just a built-in function.

There are a lot of ways to format a string.  It should be noted that the "%s" formatting is being deprecated in 3.1 or 3.2, and removed subsequently.  All the others will remain valid, though in Python 3 print is no longer a statement, but a function.

Strings can be enlosed in single- or double-quotes, and within the string, the other can be used without escaping.  This is probably worth showing.  Also, we can pass python raw strings using r'' formatting, which doesn't require escaping anything, including characters like '\n'.
