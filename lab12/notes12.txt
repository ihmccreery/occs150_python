Notes for moving Lab 12 from Java to Python 2.6

General OOP in Python:

Private variables:

One major difference between Python and Java is that Python doesn't have any parallels to private variables.  For example, in PIL, the Image class just has size as a public variable.  See below:

>>> from PIL import Image
>>> im = Image.new('RGB', (100, 100), (127, 0, 0))
>>>
>>> im.size = 4
>>> im.show()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: 'int' object is unsubscriptable
>>>
>>> im.size = (100, 100)
>>> im.show() # displays image with no problems
>>>
>>> im.size = (200, 200)
>>> im.show()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
SystemError: tile cannot extend outside image

Python 3 changes this slightly, allowing a user to define a property (using the @property decorator), which can then only be accessed with the @property.setter-decorated function, but Python 2 has nothing of this sort.

Python does provide name mangling for identifiers that begin with '__':

But, I was surprised to see that PIL doesn't even impliment this with their size variables. . .

---

Modules:

Python has modules, which seem to provide functionality not easily analogous to any of Java's abilities.

---

Classes:

One can impliment more than one class in a file, so a program might define all the classes it needs inside one file.

---

Docstrings:

Are good.  See PEP-0257.  They are also supremely useful for testing with doctest.testmod().

---

__init__, inheritance, and super():

These things work very differently in Python 2 than in Python 3.  Be particularly aware that a class must inherit object in order for super to work:

	class Deck(object):
		# code
	
	class BlackjackDeck(Deck):
		def __init__():
			super(BlackjackDeck, self).__init__()

---

Plans for implimentation:

lab12
	./Cards
		__init__.py
		Card.py
			class Card
			class Rank
				dict Ranks
			class Suit
				dict Suits
		Deck.py
			class Deck
			class EuchreDeck
			class Blackjack Deck
		Player.py
			class Player

---

Deck:

No need for isEmpty because Python treats 0 as False and all other numbers as True, so we can just use size.

---

Go Fish!

Ok, now the good stuff.

I defined an overarching Player class in the module I created, so I'm going to extend that rather than building up from scratch.

I'm not sure we need a player_number for each player, but we'll see.

I really need to learn how to use lambda functions.  I'll ask Garret about that this afternoon and see if he can help me out.

Still to go:
    game doesn't end when cards run out.
    take that into account for players who draw
    players need to draw 5 cards if their hand runs out!
    write methods for human player
