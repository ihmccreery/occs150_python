Notes for moving Lab 12 from Java to Python 2.6

A few notes about differences:

One major difference between Python and Java is that Python doesn't have any parallels to private variables.  For example, in PIL, the Image class just has size as a public variable.  See below:

>>> from PIL import Image
>>> im = Image.new('RGB', (100, 100), (127, 0, 0))
>>>
>>> im.size = 4
>>> im.show()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: 'int' object is unsubscriptable
>>>
>>> im.size = (100, 100)
>>> im.show() # displays image with no problems
>>>
>>> im.size = (200, 200)
>>> im.show()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
SystemError: tile cannot extend outside image

Python 3 changes this slightly, allowing a user to define a property (using the @property decorator), which can then only be accessed with the @property.setter-decorated function, but Python 2 has nothing of this sort.

Python does provide name mangling for identifiers that begin with '__':

But, I was surprised to see that PIL doesn't even impliment this with their size variables. . .
