critter.py

Got the abstract class thing working.  See Critter/critter.py.

I'm not making __init__() or fight_over() methods abstract methods, so if a subclass doesn't want to impliment them, that's fine.

However, if the subclass does impliment __init__(), it MUST call super(subclass, self).__init__(x, y) in order to properly work.
Alternatively, I could write in a seperate init method which, if implimented by the subclass, wouldn't overwrite the __init__, but instead would be called by Critter.__init__().

Perhaps I should make the constants into objects themselves, rather than passing around ints. . . more on that.
