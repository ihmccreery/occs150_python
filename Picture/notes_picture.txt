The way you were setting colors didn't work because you can't say color[0] = r, in other words, tuples don't accept assignments (which is the error I got when running my client). I changed it to make a new tuple using the new color combined with the tuple of the old one, as you can see. 

Python doesn't seem to be able to support multiple methods with the same name but different arguments. This is a problem in the setPenColor method, which in the original class can take either a Color (in string format) or an RGB value. I suppose we will just have people input their RGB values as "rgb(r, g, b)" so we can have the penColor stay a String, which is consistent with the color formatting from earlier.
