Lab 3 notesMonteCarloPi – This was basically straightforward as well. I notice that the math and random functions require you to NOT add Math. or Random. in front of the method you’re invoking. There is also a useful math function for finding the hypotenuse of a right triangle that I used for the distance formula, because it is the same as the distance formula we used (square root of x2 + y2). I think Java has it too and we just used the square root function, but I like that it’s nice and neat this way. Slingshot – This was basically straightforward as well, except that I haven’t been able to implement the Python Imaging Library, so for now I’m without any picture capabilities. Oh well.
