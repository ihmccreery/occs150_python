Monte Carlo:

This seems like a good time to introduce exception handling, since we're starting to talk about methods, so I put exception handling into this program.  It's certainly not necessary, though.

Pyramid:

Water Balloon Fight:

The section of the lab on splash radius doesn't (as far as I can tell) actually state what the splash radius is. . . though there is mention of a target with radius 12.  This should be clarified.

Seems like this could really benefit from discussion of data-types (tuples, in particular, for the coordinate system would allow the main method to call more methods which return target and balloon_hit variables of type tuple).  It also looks like the PIL's functionality makes use of tuples a lot, though this could be covered up with the new picture class.
