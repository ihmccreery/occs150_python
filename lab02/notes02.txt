Notes for moving Lab 02 from Java to Python 2.6

Time Warp:

Program Outline

# SecondConverter.java
# Translate seconds into a more readable hours, minutes, and seconds.
# 
# <your name>
# <today's date>

# Explain via console output what this program does.
# Assign variable sec to user's number of seconds from the console.
# (You may want to look back at lab01 on how to get user input.)
# Compute and assign hours, mins, and seconds from the user's input.
# Print the results.

Multi-line strings are written with triple quotes.

This program will actually impliment input() rather than raw_input() because we're taking in a number rather than a string.  This will probably require some explaining, maybe an arithmetic example.

Loopin':

An equivalent to the final keyword does not exist in Python.  Python leaves it up to coders to follow the convention of not changing variables that are uppercase.

Also, for loops work differently in Python than in Java: they iterate over iterables, rather than taking in expressions to evaluate/execute.  So, we use the range(x, y) function, which generates a list of integers from x up to but not including y, passed through the reversed() function.

Since these programs require integers the user puts in, it might make sense to cover exception handling here.  While it's not commonly taught early on in a course, as far as I can tell, it seems to be a pretty vital and useful part of Python.

Interesting:

Some complex string formatting going on here, not sure if that's necessary or not.

Patterns:

Some funky string formatting going on here, too, but there are ways to complete these patterns that don't involve that.  See comments.

I remember these seeming a bit tedious when I did them; perhaps there are too many of the same flavor.  Something to consider.
